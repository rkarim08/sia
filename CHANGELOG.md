## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- Tiered transformer stack (T0–T3): model manager, ONNX session pool,
  SHA-256 verified downloader, cross-encoder reranking (mxbai-rerank-base-v1),
  SIA attention fusion head, dual embeddings (bge-small + jina-code), GLiNER
  on-device NER, feedback collection, and IPS-debiased fusion trainer.
- Auto-reindex: incremental repo reindexing triggered by SessionStart and
  PostToolUse(Bash) hooks; only re-parses files whose content hash changed.
- Nous cognitive layer: four always-active hooks (SessionStart drift,
  PreToolUse significance, PostToolUse discomfort + surprise, Stop episode)
  plus five MCP tools — `nous_state`, `nous_reflect`, `nous_curiosity`,
  `nous_concern`, `nous_modify`.
- MCP surface expanded to 29 tools (added the five Nous tools above).

### Changed
- Search pipeline is now a five-stage path: BM25 + graph + vector retrieval
  → neighbor expansion → cross-encoder filter (T3) → RRF fallback → attention
  fusion (T1+). Lower tiers skip the stages whose models are unavailable.

### Fixed
- 15 pre-existing test failures in AST extractors and subgraph extract.
- 3,821 Biome lint errors caused by a missing `node_modules` exclusion in
  the lint glob.

### Security
- Bumped `@anthropic-ai/sdk` from 0.79 to 0.81 (memory-tool sandbox escape).
- Bumped `vite` from 5.4 to 6.4.2 (path traversal).
